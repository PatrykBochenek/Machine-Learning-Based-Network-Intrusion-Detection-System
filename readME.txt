ANOMALY-BASED NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION AND INCIDENT RESPONSE SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Should you want to run the notebook files again, they should be run on Google Colab for best performance as it is optimised to run on there.

Alterations to the directories may be neccessary.

The notebooks should preferably be viewed in the following order:

1.)data_processing.ipynb
2.)classifier.ipynb
3.)simulation.ipynb

Other important files such as:

incident.py
incident_response_library.py
attack_model.py
intrusion_model.py

are found in the '~/DISSERTATION/simulation/utils/ ' directory. While they are simply classes they can
help understand the structure of the Incident Response System.
